Today is not that day!

You can't handle the truth!

Frankly my dear I don't give a d**n!

Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men! Machine men with machine hearts!

Quite Wart

A man with priorities so far out of wack doesn't deserve such a fine automobile!

Life's like a box of chocolates you never know whacha gonna git.
